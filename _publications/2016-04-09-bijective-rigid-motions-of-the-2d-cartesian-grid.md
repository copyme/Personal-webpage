**Abstract:** Rigid motions are fundamental operations in image processing. While they are
bijective and isometric in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, they lose these properties when digitized in
$$\mathbb{Z}^2$$. To investigate these defects, we first extend a combinatorial model of the local
behavior of rigid motions on $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$, initially proposed by Nouvel and Rémila for rotations
on $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$.  This allows us to study bijective rigid motions on $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$, and to
propose two algorithms for verifying whether a given rigid motion restricted to a given finite
subset of $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$ is bijective.
