**Abstract:** Euclidean rotations in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ are bijective and isometric maps.
Nevertheless, they lose these properties when digitized in $$\mathbb{Z}^n$$. For $$n=2$$, the subset
of bijective digitized rotations has been described explicitly by Nouvel and Rémila and more
recently by Roussillon and Cœurjolly. In the case of 3D digitized rotations, the same
characterization has remained an open problem. In this article, we propose an algorithm for
certifying the bijectivity of 3D digitized rational rotations using the arithmetic properties of the
Lipschitz quaternions.
