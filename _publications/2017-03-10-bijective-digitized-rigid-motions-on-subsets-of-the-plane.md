**Abstract:** Rigid motions in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ are fundamental operations in 2D image processing.
They satisfy many properties: in particular, they are isometric and therefore bijective. Digitized
rigid motions, however, lose these two properties. To investigate the lack of injectivity or
surjectivity and more generally their local behavior, we extend the framework initially proposed by
Nouvel and Rémila to the case of digitized rigid motions. Yet, for practical applications, the
relevant information is not global bijectivity, which is seldom achieved, but bijectivity of the
motion restricted to a given finite subset of $$\mathbb{R}^2$$. We propose two algorithms testing
that condition. Finally, because rotation angles are rarely given with infinite precision, we
propose a third algorithm providing optimal angle intervals that preserve this restricted
bijectivity.
