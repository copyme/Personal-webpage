**Abstract:** Rigid transformations in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ are known to preserve the shape, and are
often applied to digital images. However, digitized rigid transformations, defined as digital
functions from $$\mathbb{Z}^n$$ to $$\mathbb{Z}^n$$ do not preserve shapes in general; indeed, they
are almost never bijective and thus alter the topology. In order to understand the causes of such
topological alterations, we first study the possible loss of voxel information and modification of
voxel adjacencies induced by applications of digitized rigid transformations to 3D digital images.
We then show that even very simple structured images such as digital half-spaces may not preserve
their topology under these transformations. This signifies that a simple extension of the
two-dimensional solution for topology preservation cannot be made in three dimensions.
