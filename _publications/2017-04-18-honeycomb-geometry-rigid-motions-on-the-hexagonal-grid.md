**Abstract:** Euclidean rotations in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ are bijective and isometric maps, but they
lose generally these properties when digitized in discrete spaces. In particular, the topological
and geometrical defects of digitized rigid motions on the square grid have been studied.  In this
context, the main problem is related to the incompatibility between the square grid and rotations;
in general, one has to accept either relatively high loss of information or non-exactness of the
applied digitized rigid motion. Motivated by these considerations, we study digitized rigid motions
on the hexagonal grid.  We establish a framework for studying digitized rigid motions in the
hexagonal grid---previously proposed for the square grid and known as neighborhood motion maps.
This allows us to study non-injective digitized rigid motions on the hexagonal grid and to compare
the loss of information between digitized rigid motions defined on the two grids.
