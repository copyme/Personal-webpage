title: "Characterization of 3D bijective digitized rotations"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/2017-06-06-3d-bij
excerpt: 'Euclidean rotations in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ are bijective and isometric maps. Nevertheless,
they lose these properties when digitized in $$\mathbb{Z}^n$$. For $$n=2$$, the subset of bijective
digitized rotations has been described explicitly by Nouvel and Rémila and more recently by
Roussillon and Cœurjolly.  In the case of 3D digitized rotations, the same characterization has
remained an open problem.  We have been studied the problem and up-to-date, we have propose an
algorithm for certifying the bijectivity of 3D digitized rational rotations using the arithmetic
properties of the Lipschitz quaternions.'

Euclidean rotations in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ are bijective and isometric maps. Nevertheless, they lose
these properties when digitized in $$\mathbb{Z}^n$$. For $$n=2$$, the subset of bijective digitized
rotations has been described explicitly by Nouvel and Rémila and more recently by Roussillon and
Cœurjolly.  In the case of 3D digitized rotations, the same characterization has remained an open
problem.  

We have been studied the problem and up-to-date, we have propose an algorithm for certifying the
bijectivity of 3D digitized rational rotations using the arithmetic properties of the Lipschitz
quaternions.  In [Bijectivity Certification of 3D Digitized
Rotations](../publication/2016-06-02-bijectivity-certification-of-3d-digitized-rotations) we
introduced an algorithm to verify whether a 3D digitized rotation induced by a Lipschitz quaternion
is bijective or not (see [QuaternionCertification](../software/2016-quaternion-cert)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.814569.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.814569)).

Currently, we are working on the analytical characterization of 3D bijective digitized rotations. We
invite anybody who would like to work on this project to start from studying properties of some
Lipschitz quaternions certified by our algorithm as ones which lead to 3D bijective digitized
rotations. 

The list of such quaternions, which induce bijective digitized rotations, from the range
$$[-10,10]^4$$ can be downloaded from [zenodo.org](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.814552) (please

Also, the list of quaternions from the range $$[-10,10]^4$$, which do not induce 3D bijective
digitized rotations can be downloaded from [zenodo.org](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.814607)

University of Poitiers, XLIM for pointing out a bug in an early implementation of the algorithm.

Many thanks for [Victor Ostromoukhov](http://liris.cnrs.fr/victor.ostromoukhov/) of University of
Lyon 1, LIRIS, France, for pointing out that the list of Lipschitz quaternions given in the paper is
not complete. This led us to a discovery of a bug in our code. The current list of Lipschitz
quaternions which induce bijectivie digitized rotations (see the link above) contain 576 more
quaternions than the one to which link was given in the paper.
