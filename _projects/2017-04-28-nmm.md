2D neighborhood motion maps have allowed us to study local alterations of discrete spaces under
digitized rigid motions. Nevertheless, computation of neighborhood motions maps in $$\mathbb{Z}^3$$
is a challenging problem. In [Quadric Arrangement in Classifying Rigid Motions of a 3D Digital
Image](../plublication/2016-09-09-quadric-arrangement-in-classifying-rigid-motions-of-a-3d-digital-image.html)
we have introduced the first algorithm to compute neighborhood motion maps in $$\mathbb{Z}^3$$. Our
implementation evolved since (see [RigidMotionsMapleTools](../software/3d-nmm)) and has been
improved. 

Up to date we have managed to compute
====

- Neighborhood motions maps of $$\mathcal{N}_1$$ (6-neighborhood). [Download database
  file](../files/N1_NMM.db.tar.gz) (Last update 2017-04-28)

- Neighborhood motions maps of $$\mathcal{N}_2$$ (18-neighborhood). [Download database
  file](../files/N2_NMM.db.tar.gz) (Last update 2017-04-28)

The files are SQLite3 databases. You can use our
[3DNMMVierwerDB](https://github.com/copyme/NeighborhoodMotionMapsTools) to visualize neighborhood
maps and see the parameters for which they were obtained.


Indeed, the issue of computations of neighborhood motions maps of $$\mathcal{N}_3$$ is still out of
our reach.  We have been working on this issue.
