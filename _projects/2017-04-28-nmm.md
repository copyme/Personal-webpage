2D neighborhood motion maps have allowed us to study local alterations of discrete spaces under
digitized rigid motions. Nevertheless, computation of 3D neighborhood motions maps is a challenging
problem. In [Quadric Arrangement in Classifying Rigid Motions of a 3D Digital
Image](../publication/2016-09-09-quadric-arrangement-in-classifying-rigid-motions-of-a-3d-digital-image)
we have introduced the first algorithm to compute neighborhood motion maps for digitized rigid
motions on $$\mathbb{Z}^3$$. Our implementation evolved since (see
[RigidMotionsMapleTools](../software/2017-3d-nmm)) and has been improved.

Up to date we have managed to compute
====

- Neighborhood motions maps of $$\mathcal{N}_1$$ (6-neighborhood). [Download database
  file](../files/N1_NMM.db.tar.gz) (Last update 2017-04-30)

- ~~Neighborhood motions maps of $$\mathcal{N}_2$$ (18-neighborhood). [Download database
  file](../files/N2_NMM.db.tar.gz) (Last update 2017-04-28)~~ **This database does not contain all
  neighborhood motions maps for** $$\mathcal{N}_2$$. We run re-computations. Please, check out this
  page soon for an updated file.

The files are SQLite3 databases. You can use our
[3DNMMVierwerDB](https://github.com/copyme/NeighborhoodMotionMapsTools) to visualize neighborhood
maps and see the parameters for which they were obtained.

Recently, we have been working on the issue of computing neighborhood motions maps of
$$\mathcal{N}_3$$ (26-neighborhood). 


How to cite
====

Any results obtained with the database should cite [*Quadric Arrangement in Classifying Rigid
Motions of a 3D Digital
Image*](../publication/2016-09-09-quadric-arrangement-in-classifying-rigid-motions-of-a-3d-digital-image)
and should mention a timestamp of the database. Adding a timestamp is particularly important since
due to possible bugs we might need to recompute neighborhood motion maps.
