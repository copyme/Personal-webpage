I obtained my engineering degree in computer science at the University of Computer Sciences and
Skills, Poland in 2013. I was admitted to the research oriented master program [Labex Bézout in
computer science and mathematics at the University
Paris-Est](http://bezout.univ-paris-est.fr/en/master-s-program), France from where I obtained a
master degree in computer science in 2014, and where I currently pursues doctoral studies under the
supervision of [Yukiko Kenmochi](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~kenmochi/) and [Pascal
Romon](http://perso-math.univ-mlv.fr/users/romon.pascal/).  We collaborate with [Nicolas
Passat](http://crestic.univ-reims.fr/membre/1542-nicolas-passat) and [Guillaume
Moroz](https://members.loria.fr/GMoroz/). Recently, we are about to start new projects with [David
Cœurjolly](http://liris.cnrs.fr/%7Edcoeurjo/) and [Tristan
Roussillon](http://liris.cnrs.fr/~troussil/).  Currently, I also discover other fields of science by
collaboration with other PhD students at the University Paris-Est – namely geotechnical engineering
– which is new and very challenging for me. During my engineering studies in Poland I worked with
[Marcin Janaszewski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcin_Janaszewski) and [Michał
Postolski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michat_Postolski) on problems related to modeling
and segmentation of human airways. I plan to defend my PhD thesis in October 2017.

My research focuses on topological and geometrical alterations induced by digitized rigid motions
defined on regular grids. I am mainly interested in theoretical aspects of digital geometry and
digital topology.  My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3.
