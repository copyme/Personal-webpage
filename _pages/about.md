I obtained my engineering degree in computer science at the University of Computer
Sciences and Skills, Poland in 2013. I was admitted to the research oriented master program Labex
BÃ©zout in computer science and mathematics at the University Paris-Est, France from where I
obtained a master degree in computer science in 2014, and where I currently pursues doctoral
studies.  

My research focuses on topological and geometrical alterations of digital sets induced by digitized
rigid motions defined on regular grids.
